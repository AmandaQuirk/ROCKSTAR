# ROCKSTAR

*mapping_ROCKSTAR_subhalos: uses pygad and ROCKSTAR ouput to visually display satellite galaxies found by ROCKSTAR (4x4 two models and DM and stars)

*massdensity: creates a histogram displaying the masses of the galaxies found by ROCKSTAR

*onemodel_mapping_ROCKSTAR_subhalos: uses pygad and ROCKSTAR ouput to visually display satellite galaxies found by ROCKSTAR but only for the star particles of one model

*projectdensity: creates a projected number density for a single halo with the different models

*rescomp_massdistrib: compares the mass distribution of a low resolution to a high resolution; marks the mass cut

*stacked_mass: projected satellite stellar mass as a function of radius for N galaxies for various models

*stacked_mass_number: number density of satellite galaxies as a function of mass ratio for N galaxies for various models

*uniquedistances: outputs a list of all (mass, distances) and then a distances that are not overcounted
